# DevFest - Generative AI Question Generation System

## Overview
DevFest is a Generative AI-powered project designed to assist event participants by generating relevant questions based on data submitted through a Google Form. The generated questions are tailored to the filled data and are intended to facilitate insightful conversations with mentors present at the event.

This project leverages Google Sheets to store submitted form data, processes it to understand the participantâ€™s context, and uses Generative AI to generate potential questions that mentors might be asked.

## Features
- **Google Form Integration**: Collect data from participants and store it in Google Sheets seamlessly.
- **Data Processing**: Extract and analyze data from Google Sheets.
- **AI-Powered Question Generation**: Use the Google Generative AI API to generate tailored questions for participants.
- **Responsive and Interactive UI**: Built with modern tools like React and TailwindCSS for a sleek user experience.
